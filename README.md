# web_scraping_challenge
This webscraping project involved scraping the web for desired data in order to create our own personalized webpage to showcase what he had found. We would need to utilize Flask, Splinter, Python, MongoDB, Python, HTML, and Bootstrap to complete this task. The purpose of this project was to garner the ability to automate webscraping and gather desired information from many desired sources to then be displayed locally using Flask. 

This project involved taking the following steps:

-Scraping 4 different websites and collecting desired data using the browser's inspector tool, BeautifulSoup, and Splinter
-Convert scraping into a function in a python file to then import into a Flask application
-Pass our now collected data objects into a Mongo database as a python dictionary
-Create a template HTML file and display our extracted results by making requests into the now occupied database
-Use Bootstrap to structure the final HTML
